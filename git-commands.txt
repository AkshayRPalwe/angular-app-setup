    - git config --global user.email "palweakshay20@gmail.com"
    - git config --list

- Commands
    
    - Clone: Cloning a Repository to our local machine
        - git clone <Link>
    
    - status: Displays the state of the code
        - git status
            - untracked 
                file new files that git doesnt yet tracked
            - modified 
                changed
            - staged 
                file ready to committed
            - unmodified 
                unchanged

    - Add and committ
        add: adds new or changed files in your working directory to git staginhg area
            - git add <file_name>
            - git add .

        commit: It is record of change
            - git commit -m "meaningfull message"

    - Push Command
        push: uplaod local repo content to remote repo
            - git push origin main
                - origin: This is the default name given to the remote repository from which you cloned your local repository. "Origin" is a common convention, but you might see a different name if you've renamed it or if there are multiple remotes.
                - main: This is the branch that you want to push to the remote repository. "Main" is a common name for the default branch, but it could be "master" or another branch name depending on your repository's configuration.

Init Command
init: used to create a new git repo
To push
    - git init
    - git remote add origin <link>
    - git remote -v (to verify remote)
    - git branch (to check btanch)
    - git btanch -M main (To change name from master to main - git new policies)
    - git push origin main

    * git push -u origin main --> to save branch name for future - we can do "git push" only from now on

Workflow
    Local Git 

Git branches:

    - git branch (to check branch)
    - git btanch -M main (To change name from master to main)
    - git checkout <brachName>
    - git checkout -b <brachName> (to create new btanch and )
        - git checkout -b feature1
    - git branch -d brachname (to delete new btanch)

    - git push origin feature1

    - git diff main
    - git merge main

Pull request:
    It lets you tell others about changes you have pushed to a branch in a repository

Pull Command:
    It lets you tell others about changes you have pushed to branch in a repository on Github
    - git pull origin main

Resolving merge conflicts
    An event that takes place where Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.


Undoing changes:

    case 1: staged changes 
        - git reset <file_name>
        - git reset

    case 2: committed changes(for  one commit)
        - git reset HEAD~1

    case 3: commited changes (for many commits)
        - git reset <commit hash>
        - git reset --hard <commit hash>

Fork
    A fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility setting with the original "upstream" repository.

    Fork is a rough copy.
